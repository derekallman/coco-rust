## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-15

### Added

- Pure Rust COCO API — dataset loading, indexing, querying (bbox, segmentation, keypoints)
- Full evaluation pipeline with all 12 AP/AR metrics (10 for keypoints)
- Pure Rust RLE encoding/decoding (no C FFI)
- Rayon-based parallel evaluation
- CLI tool (`coco-cli`) with `--no-cats` flag
- PyO3 Python bindings (`coco_rs` package) with numpy interop
- `init_as_pycocotools()` drop-in replacement via `sys.modules` patching
- camelCase aliases for pycocotools API compatibility
- `eval_imgs` and `eval` properties on COCOeval
- MkDocs documentation site with GitHub Actions deployment
- Performance optimizations: fused intersection, analytical `fr_bbox`, pre-computed indexing, in-place precision interpolation (11-26x faster than pycocotools)

### Fixed

- Zero-length RLE run handling in `intersection_area` and `merge_two`
- `iscrowd` vs `gt_ignore` matching bug in evaluation
- RLE string delta encoding parity with maskApi.c
- Segmentation and keypoints metric parity with pycocotools
