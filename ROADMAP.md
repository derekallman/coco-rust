# Roadmap

Planned features and improvements, organized by theme.

## Architecture

All core logic lives in the Rust library. The Python package and Rust CLI are thin wrappers.

```
                       ┌──→ PyO3 ──→ Python Library + CLI (full-featured)
Rust Core (all logic) ─┤
                       └──→ coco-eval (Rust CLI, eval only)
```

- **Rust core** — types, masks, eval, dataset ops, format conversion, streaming
- **Python CLI** (primary) — all subcommands: `$ coco eval`, `$ coco stats`, `$ coco merge`, `$ coco plot`, etc. Rich formatting, plots via matplotlib/plotly.
- **Rust CLI** — evaluation only: `$ coco-eval`. JSON/CSV/markdown output, no plots, no Python. New features are added on request.

| Registry | Package | Contents |
|----------|---------|----------|
| PyPI | `coco-kit` | Python library + Python CLI + compiled Rust core |
| crates.io | `coco-kit` | Rust library |
| crates.io | `coco-cli` | `coco-eval` binary (eval only, no Python) |

## Dataset Statistics

Quick health check for any COCO dataset — annotation counts per category, image size distributions, area distributions, crowd/iscrowd breakdown. Available as `coco.stats()` in Python and `coco stats` in the Python CLI.

## Dataset Operations

Split, merge, filter, and sample COCO datasets:

- **Filter** — subset by category, image ID, area range, or custom predicate
- **Merge** — combine multiple annotation files (e.g., separate labeling batches)
- **Split** — stratified train/val/test split preserving category distribution
- **Sample** — random or deterministic subset for quick iteration

All implemented in Rust core, exposed via Python CLI and Python API.

## Format Conversion

COCO ↔ YOLO, COCO ↔ Pascal VOC, COCO ↔ CVAT. Everyone has a slightly broken converter script — a correct, fast, well-tested one has high value. High surface area though, so this should be scoped carefully (start with YOLO, the most requested).

## Streaming Evaluation

Evaluate datasets that don't fit in memory. Process annotations in chunks without loading the full ground truth and detection sets upfront. Critical for production datasets with millions of annotations.

## Confusion Matrices

Per-category confusion matrix generation to identify systematic misclassifications.

## TIDE Error Analysis

Error decomposition following [TIDE](https://github.com/dbolya/tide) — classification, localization, duplicate, background, and missed errors.

## Hierarchical Evaluation

Open Images-style evaluation with category hierarchies, where a detection of a parent category is not penalized against a child.

## Video Sequence Analysis

Lightweight per-sequence metric breakdowns for video object detection, surfacing high-level trends like which clips perform worst. Not a substitute for dedicated tracking suites (MOT, HOTA) — just a quick diagnostic view.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions CI (shipped):

- ~~`cargo test` / `cargo clippy` / `cargo fmt --check`~~
- ~~Cross-platform matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows)~~
- ~~Python smoke test (`maturin develop` + inline import/eval check)~~

Deferred:

- Automated release publishing to crates.io and PyPI
